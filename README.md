### Goal
Create a golfable implementation of Conway's game of life in javascript. While small size is the ultimate goal, implementation still needs to meet the requirements below.

### Requirements
1. Implement the rules of Conway's game of life
1. Create a board that fills the window with squares
1. Board should stay in place if the user scrolls
1. Board should be translucent so the user can still see the original content
1. The board should have a wrapping boundary condition
1. Starting pattern should be a *gun* (a finite pattern with unbounded growth)
1. Starting pattern should be centered on the screen regardless of window size.
